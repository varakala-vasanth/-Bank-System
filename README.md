# -Bank-System
The Bank Loan System is a simple full-stack web application built using Node.js and vanilla HTML/JavaScript that simulates a bank’s loan management system. It allows the bank to lend money to customers, record payments, and view detailed transaction ledgers and account overviews—all from a web interface.
